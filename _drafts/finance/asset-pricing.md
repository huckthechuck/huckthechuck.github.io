# Asset pricing and earnings
Stock prices rise in proportion to the company's earnings. A stock that is priced 3-4 times the company's annual earnings is considered a good asset for investments. Stocks trading at 10 times the company's earnings do not have any room for discounting, and are over-valued. Such stocks must only be purchased if one believes in the Greater fool theory, i.e.: someone else will be willing to take such stocks at a higher price from the current owner.

Stocks available at 3 times the company's annual earnings may not happen again in our lifetimes, this is because with the advent of the internet and high-speed trading, such mispriced opportunities are going to be exploited before individual/small investors have a chance of discovering such mispricing.
