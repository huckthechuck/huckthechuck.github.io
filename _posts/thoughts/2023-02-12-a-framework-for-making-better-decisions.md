## A framework for making good decisions
Young adults tend to be easily swayed because of their relatively limited set of experiences. However, the decisions we make when we are young tend to have the most impact on our lives. For instance, the choices we make as teenagers determine what we do for a living, where we live, whom we marry, and what friends we associate with. These, in turn, affect how happy we are, how successful we are, and the overall quality of our lives.

Since experiences take time to build, how do we go about making good decisions in life?

Making good decisions requires us to explore a good set of options to choose from and the ability to compare those options effectively against a set of meaningful criteria.
Often, all the available options may not be apparent to us because of our lack of knowledge. Even if we know the available options, we may fail to discover a set of meaningful criteria against which each choice must be evaluated. When we know the criteria, we could still be blindsided by our innate biases or succumb to peer pressure and decide badly.

So, how do we improve the odds of making good decisions under such circumstances?

One way is to consult with people who have made similar decisions in life. Speak with multiple individuals, if possible, to avoid getting biased by one individual's recommendations.

We should seek out individuals who made similar decisions, or try to find people who share the same values or interests as us. We can be misled by speaking with people who share very different interests or motivations than us. We may find that the choices they made, are not a good fit for our natural interests, talents, or motivations. If we cannot find a person with similar experiences or shared interests, then we can rely on a friend we trust.

We should be aware though that, when faced with the same decision, the same choices and the same information, different people will arrive at different decisions, because we all value different things in life, and use different criteria to make the decision.

I also find it often unnecessary to ask the question: "What do you recommend I do?". The response to that question will be an outcome of the biases the individual holds. I'd rather ask them how they went about making the decision, and how satisfied are they with the decision.

When we have identified individuals who have made similar decisions, I would rather ask them the following questions:
1. How they went about making the choice?
2. The background context and the criteria they used to decide.
3. What new choices, criteria, or context have they uncovered since they made the decision?
4. How happy they have been with the decision? If they are unhappy, why?
5. Would they make the same choice again if they had the opportunity to?

A few other tricks I find useful are:
1. Consider what advice we would give to a close friend who approached us with a similar decision.
2. Narrowing down the list of options by excluding choices that violate our most important criteria, or go against our natural interests or the values we cherish.
3. Thinking about the worst possible choice we can make, and avoiding it.

### Short-term vs Long-term decisions
Some decisions tend to have a short shelf-life, while others have lifelong consequences. For instance, the impact of the beverage we have at a coffee shop, or the choice of the meal we have, rarely last beyond a few hours. While choices like which profession we take up, whom we marry, and where we live often determine our mental state for the next few years or decades or even our lifetime. So, it is wise we spend more time on longer-term decisions than short-term ones. Also, when making long-term decisions is critically important we pay attention to our core abilities, our natural talents, and interests - things that are personal to us and more important than financial rewards, or other outwardly socio-economic rewards. It helps to listen to our gut instincts when making such decisions because that's a way of our subconscious mind reminding us of deep-seated preferences that we may be unaware of, or do not publicly acknowledge.

### Dreadful decisions
Sometimes we face dreadful decisions. No one likes to make dreadful decisions, but we are likely to face at least five to ten decisions in our lifetimes that we completely dread but have to inevitably make. There is no way around them. When faced with such situations in the past, I have delayed making the decision for as long as I could, sometimes left the decisions to chance, or chose to go with the choice that involved the least amount of unpleasantness, or required the least amount of efforts, or seemed the easiest.

It is easy to say things like: "don't defer such decisions", "give yourself a deadline and commit to making a decision before the deadline" etc. However, it requires a great deal of courage to decide in such situations (e.g.: deciding whether to continue a critically ill family member on life-support). At this point in life, I do not have a strong framework to handle such situations. However, I did find it very useful to talk to others in such situations. Especially, elders that have faced such situations themselves, or friends that I trust.

### Evaluating decisions
We normally try to assess the quality of our decisions by evaluating how often our decisions led to the desired outcomes - the success rate. However, there is a potential flaw with this process. Important decisions are made well in advance of their outcomes, sometimes it takes years or even decades before the outcome of a decision is apparent. For instance, when a student decides between taking up law or medicine, it takes a minimum of 5 years and up to a decade, or even longer, before the outcome of their decision is apparent. Also, the outcome or its perception may change as the years pass by; a good doctor or advocate may burn out and end up badly in the future, or may continually hone their skills and excel at the job over time. On the other hand, a decision to sell an asset is an irreversible decision that has a concrete outcome that is unlikely to change with time.

In either case, the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on the outcome. There will be factors that intervene between when the decision was made and when the outcome is achieved. New professions may take the limelight that was previously held by others (e.g.: In the Victorian era being a nobleman was more highly regarded than a doctor), economic conditions may reverse (e.g.: Socialism generally fell out of favor in the 1980s and was quickly replaced by capitalism even in countries that were strongly communist), asset-classes tend to fall out of favor (e.g.: In recent years, crypto-currencies quickly fell out of favor once the easy flow of credit caused by low-interest rates subsided).

The value in tracking decision quality then lies in mainly improving the odds of making good decisions in the future, by incorporating lessons learned from the past. We usually find that we did not need to ponder over as much as we did over some of our decisions. We may also find that the data we considered critical may not have been really critical, or we missed other more critical data or criteria when deciding. These lessons allow us an opportunity to avoid repeating the same mistakes and thereby improve the odds of making better decisions.

### Conclusion
I hope this encourages you to think for yourself a framework for making better decisions in the future.
