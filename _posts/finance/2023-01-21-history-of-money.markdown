The history of money is rather simple. Money as we know it the current paper and coins form has only existed for the last X years. However, people have existed for Y years prior to the invention of money. How did people survive before the invention of money? The answer to that question is: bartering. The bartering system worked in the following way: people specialized in different fields in the past, some were hunters, some were medicine-men, some were ironsmiths, some were wood-workers, some were farmers, and some domesticated animals. When an ironsmith needed to feed his family, he would go to the farmer and barter some item he created, let's say a plough, for a bag of grains. Now this seems simple, but the utility of this quickly wanes out, as a plough will serve the farmer for many years, however the bag of grains would quickly be consumed by the ironsmith's family. So, the plough would have to fetch the ironsmith many bags or grain and not just one. So, people may have pegged the value of the plough at 10 bags of grain, of which the farmer only had 5 at the time. Now if the farmer wanted to buy some hens, he would have to establish a different bartering rate with the rancher, the doctor would need to do the same with the farmer and the rancher and so on.
